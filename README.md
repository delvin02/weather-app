#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asLfrF4qNqA 
#### Description:
Effortlessly find the weather through the web app! Simply input your desired location to receive current weather updates. For even quicker access, you have the option to save your frequently checked weather. And when you no longer need them, you can easily remove these saved locations at your convenience.
